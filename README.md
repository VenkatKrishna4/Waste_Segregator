Four Categories: Classifies items into Recyclable, Organic, Hazardous, and General Waste.

Simple Interface: A clean and user-friendly web interface for a seamless experience.

üöÄ How It Works
The core of this application is a custom-trained machine learning model.

User Input: The user uploads an image of a waste item.

Model Inference: The image is fed into a TensorFlow.js model, which has been trained on a diverse dataset of thousands of waste images.

Prediction: The model analyzes the image and outputs a probability score for each of the four categories.

Classification: The app displays the category with the highest probability as the final classification.
